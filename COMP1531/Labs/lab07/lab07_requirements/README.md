## Lab07 - Exercise - Requirements (3 points)

A client has come to you asking "I really need you to build me a new system to help students see how many available seats there are on campus."

### Part 1 - Requirements Elicitation

Pair up with someone in your lab (probably one of your group members), and have either of you occupy one of two roles:
 * One of you pretends to be the client, answering questions that the engineer has
 * One of you pretends to be the engineer, and engages in a process of requirements elicitation from the client.

Document a conversation (you could do it on an online tool then copy it across after, for example) between you where the engineer leads a process of requirements elicitation to understand the scope and requirements associated with this project.

### Part 2 - Requirements Analysis

Turn these requirements into a series of User Stories. Each user story should have one or more acceptance criteria, which can be written as scenario-based criteria (Given, When, Then) or descriptive criteria (a true/false statement). There's no set amount of User Stories you need to write, you simply need to encapsulate all of the elicited requirements.

If you feel as though you haven't got enough tangible requirements to make User Stories, go back to the elicitation step and interview further; ask more questions and explore topics more deeply.

As you write your stories, document any further questions that come to mind, as well as any assumptions you are making about the contents of your interview.

### Part 3 - Requirements Specification

Pick one 'flow' of interaction between the system and a user that makes itself evident from your User Stories (this might correspond to a single story, but can span multiple). Write a Use Case for this flow of interaction.

You can represent your use case as either a list of dot points (including a text file in this repo), or a diagram (including an image in this repo).
If you'd like to use an image, you can use a tool such as [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

Write your response in `requirements.md`.
