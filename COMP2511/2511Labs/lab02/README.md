## Marking

When marking your design and programming lab exercises, the following aspects are considered:

* Exercise is submitted on time;
* Code passes pipeline with provided JUnit tests / your tests;
* Code solves the problem and is not a hardcoded solution;
* Code is written cleanly and with good style;
* Solution is well designed, using the design principles and patterns intended by the activity; and
* Any other requirements outlined in the problem specification.

When marking your written blog posts, the following aspects are considered:

* Answers are comprehensive and thoughtful;
* Answers address all aspects of the question; and
* Answers are in the correct format as specified by the question.

Many lab exercises in future weeks will consist of a practical design and programming exercise and a written blog post reflecting on the activity. During marking you should bring up your code and your blog post and talk through your solution, thought process and reflections using your blog post as a prompt.
