## Lab05 - Exercise - Unpickle (1 point)

A pickled file with data in it is stored in `shapecolour.p`. Write a function `most_common` inside program `unpickle.py` that un-pickles this file, and analyses the data to returns what the most common shape-colour pair is.

The return value of `unpickle.py` should be (for example, if the most common dictionary pair is red circle) the dictionary:

```python
{
    "colour": "red",
    "shape": "circle"
}
```

Ensure your code is pylint compliant.
