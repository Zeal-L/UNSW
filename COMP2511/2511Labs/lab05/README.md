# Lab 05

### Due: Week 7 Monday, 8am

### Value: 8 marks towards the Class Mark

## Aims

* Understand and apply Strategy, State, and Observer Patterns
* Work and modify an already existing and non-trivial application
* Refactor and cleanup code within the scope of a non-trivial application
* Work with a real-world software problem domain (basics of SSO/authentication)

## Overview

The overall class mark for each week is out of 8 marks. 2 marks come from tutorial participation and 6 marks come from completing the following exercises.

## Core Exercises & Blogging

In order to achieve full marks for the lab, you will need to complete the following core exercises:

* [SSO](spec/sso.md) (5 marks) - only up to the end of Task 6. This is quite a large lab exercise that consists of several parts. Think of it like an actual laboratory session in physics or chemistry. You will need to do some pre-reading (watch the video) as well as a writeup (blog post reflection). We recommend you set aside 4-5 hours to complete this exericse.
* [Check-in](spec/check-in.md) (1 mark)

## Submission

To submit, make a tag to show that your code at the current commit is ready for your submission using the command:

```bash
$ git tag -fa submission -m "Submission for Lab 05"
$ git push -f origin submission
```

Or, you can create one via the GitLab website by going to **Repository > Tags > New Tag**.
We will take the last commit on your master branch before the deadline for your submission.

## Marking

When marking your design and programming lab exercises, the following aspects are considered:

* Exercise is submitted on time;
* Code passes pipeline with provided JUnit tests / your tests;
* Code solves the problem and is not a hardcoded solution;
* Code is written cleanly and with good style;
* Solution is well designed, using the design principles and patterns intended by the activity; 
* Answers to theory questions address all aspects of the question;
* Any blog posts are consistent with the code/design being described;
* Reflections and rationale is comprehensive and thoughtful
* Any other requirements outlined in the problem specification.
