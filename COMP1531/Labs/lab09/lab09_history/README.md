This repository consists of 6 commits:
 * 1. An initial commit called "Initial Commit" that contains these instructions
 * 2. A commit called "Setup" which you can ignore.
 * 3. A commit called "Commit 1" that adds a line "Line A" to `ITEMS.md`
 * 4. A commit called "Commit 2" that adds a line "Line B" to `ITEMS.md`
 * 5. A commit called "Commit 3" that adds a line "Line C" to `ITEMS.md`
 * 6. A commit called "Commit 4" that adds a line "Line D" to `ITEMS.md`
 * 7. A commit called "Commit 5" that adds a line "Line E" to `ITEMS.md`

For this lab, you are required to do a `soft reset` with GIT to the commit named "Commit 3". This soft reset will preserve all of the files as they exist prior to the reset. You will then make an amended commit with the same commit name ("Commit 3") and then do a force push to master to re-write the history such that there are only 3 commits on the repo (the most recent commit being "Commit 3"). If you can't push to master due to branch permissions, you can demonstrate this to your tutor locally in your class.

You will demonstrate the state of your repo to your tutor.
